## Software Design & Architecture 🏗️

### Architectural Patterns

#### Monolithic Architecture:

> **ELI5:** A monolithic architecture is like one big block of software where everything—user interface, logic, and database—are built together in a single unit. If one part changes or breaks, you often have to rebuild or redeploy the entire application.

#### Microservices Architecture

> **ELI5:** Microservices architecture is like building a big app out of many small, independent pieces. Each piece (microservice) does one job well and can be changed or fixed without breaking the others, making the whole system faster, easier to update, and more reliable.

#### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

> **ELI5:** ChatGPT said:Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is like a toolbox where each tool (service) does one job well—such as handling payments or sending emails—and all the tools can work together easily, even if they’re made by different people or use different technologies.

#### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

> **ELI5:** Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is like a chain reaction where things happen in response to events. When something important occurs (an “event”), it instantly triggers other parts of the system to react, helping apps stay fast, flexible, and responsive without waiting for instructions.

#### Serverless Architecture

> **ELI5:** Serverless architecture means you run code without managing servers yourself. You just upload your code, and cloud providers like AWS or Google automatically handle servers, scaling, and maintenance — you only pay when your code runs.
