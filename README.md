## Software Design Principles 🗺️

<details>
<summary>SOLID Principles</summary>

> **ELI5:** The SOLID principles are five simple rules to write clean, easy-to-change software: Single Responsibility (one job per class), Open/Closed (extend without changing), Liskov Substitution (replace without breaking), Interface Segregation (small, specific interfaces), Dependency Inversion (depend on abstractions, not details).

<summary>KISS Principle</summary>

> **ELI5:** The KISS Principle stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid." It means when designing something—like a product, system, or explanation—you should make it as simple and clear as possible. Complexity often causes mistakes, confusion, or failure, so simplicity usually works best.

<summary>DRY Principle</summary>

> **ELI5:** The DRY Principle stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." It means that in coding (or any work), you should avoid duplicating the same logic or information in multiple places. Instead, write it once and reuse it, making your code easier to maintain and less error-prone.

<summary>YAGNI Principle</summary>

> **ELI5:** The YAGNI principle, short for “You Aren’t Gonna Need It,” means you should only build features you truly need right now, not things you might need in the future. It helps keep code simple, avoids wasted effort, and prevents overcomplicating projects.

<summary>GRASP Patterns</summary>

> **ELI5:** GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) are simple guidelines for deciding which class or object should do what in a program. They help organize responsibilities, promote reuse, and keep code flexible by assigning tasks based on patterns like Creator, Controller, or Information Expert.
